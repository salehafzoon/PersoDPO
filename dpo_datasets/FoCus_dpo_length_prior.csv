User2: As a Washington State resident and lover of nature-related issues, I think its important to know that at the beginning the course of the Columbia Glacial River to the southern highlands created an ice dam, which retracted the waters of Columbia Glacial Lake, forcing them east of Washington.

Context: User1: I think Ive been there before but I dont remember the name of this place.
User2: This is the Ross Ice Shelf, the largest ice shelf of Antarctica, which you are curious about. Most of Ross Ice Shelf is in the Ross Dependency claimed by New Zealand and it floats in, and covers, a large southern portion of the Ross Sea and the entire Roosevelt Island located in the west of the Ross Sea.
User1: What is an ice shelf?
User2: Well, as you may have read about, Ice shelves are thick plates of ice, formed continuously by glaciers, that float on top of an ocean. The shelves act as ""brakes"" for the glaciers and moderate the amount of melting that occurs on the glaciers surfaces and once their ice shelves are removed, they may begin to dump more ice into the ocean than they gather as snow in their catchments.
User1: Were any discoveries made there?
User2: Yes, as you are curious about ice shelves, one of the key findings was that the ice in the region was re-freezing. This re-freezing and growth of an ice shelf are not uncommon but the Ross Ice Shelf situation appeared to be very variable as there was no evidence of long-term freezing.
User1: How is research being made there?
User2: Since you are interested in scientific explorations, you may like to know that a science team from New Zealand installed a camp in the center of the shelf in late 2017. The expedition brought together oceanographers, glaciologists, biologists, and sedimentologists to examine the ice, ocean, and sediment in the central shelf region and a second New Zealand expedition in 2019 used a remotely operated underwater vehicle designed around parameters suitable for exploration of the liquid cavities of places like Europa, a moon in Jupiter.
User1: How big is this ice shelf?
User2: The Ross Ice Shelf reaches into Antarctica from the north and covers an area of about 520,000 km2 or 200,000 sq mi, nearly the size of France! The ice mass is about 800 km or 500 miles wide and 970 km or 600 miles long.
