User2: I believe that this will greatly assist your research work for the Faculty of History and enrich your knowledge. This stone is very old indeed, the name ""London Stone"" was registered for the first time around the year 1100 and its origins are imprecise, although it is speculated that its origin is Romana; some modern statements say that the object was some kind of object of veneration, which the vast majority of scholars say they have no basis at all.

User2: I know you have been looking for current photos of the London Stone, and you must have found reports that claim that the stone is a block of oolitic limestone approximately 21 × 17 × 12 inches, and is just the top part of an object that was previously very larger. A 1960 study indicated that the stone is Clipsham Limestone, a type of stone from Rutland and probably brought to London for construction purposes in the Roman and medieval periods; another hypothesis most recently was brought up by Kevin Hayward, who suggested that it may be a Bath stone, used in monuments and sculptures in early Roman London and in the time of the Saxons.

On that occasion the Stone temporarily went to the London Museum, being returned to Cannon Street in late 2018, where today it is publicly displayed on a pedestal, within a Portland stone covering loosely inspired by its 19th century predecessor.
User1: Do you have any curiosity about London Stone?
User2: Yea! I have one of the recent additions to mythology around London Stone; the first account that the astrologer, occultist and advisor to Queen Elizabeth I, Dr. John Dee, ""was fascinated by the supposed powers of the Stone of London and lived close to it for a while"", it is believed that he may have pulled pieces of it away for performing alchemical experiments, this legend may have been inspired by John Dees 1993 novel, ""The House of Doctor Dee"".
User1: How can I visit London Stone, do you have the location?","User2: Yes, I have, The Stone is in front of Cannon Street station, on the north side of Cannon Street, in an opening in the wall of 111 Cannon Street (EC4N 5AR)."

Gold was first discovered in the Telluride region in 1858, and the fledgling mining field was founded under the name of Columbia in 1878.

He saw the potential profits from the regions natural endowments and went about creating a resort from scratch as there was little more than a few restaurants and one run down hotel at the time. Zoline hired Emile Allais, a French Olympic skier to help configure runs and lifts and consult on the design and layout of the mountain. He enlisted the help of Bill ""Senior"" Mahoney and Ed Bowers to cut trails, clear slopes, and obtain land-use rights, mining claims, and water rights for the ski company.

"I like forest reserves.I like to do expeditions in the Pacific Ocean.I am concerned with the preservation of nature, especially coral reefs.I like to know about the history of places.I plan to visit an island on my vacation.","User1: Wow, this is amazing! What is this?
User2: This is Banaba, a lonely coral island in the westernmost point of Kiribati, 185 miles east of Nauru, in the Pacific Ocean. Since you told me you like to go on expeditions in the Pacific Ocean, Ive been looking for tips from interesting places to visit on your vacation.
User1: Wow, a new place for me! tell me more about the history of this place. Is this place populated?
User2: I know you like to know about the history of the places, so I will summarize Banabas hostoria for you; the first sighting of the island was in 1801, and in 1804, Captain John Mertho named the island after his ship; many whaling ships used to visit the island in the 19th century in search of water and wood. The first recorded vist was by the Arabella in March 1832 with the last visit recorded by the Charles W. Morgan in January, 1904; approximately 295 people lived in Banaba according to the 2010 census.
User1: How would you describe the local climate, is it a tropical place?
User2: As you intend to visit an island on vacation, if you choose to go to Banaba it is good to know that the island has a tropical forest climate, with winds between the northeast and southeast, bringing rains with great annual and seasonal variability, if you intend to be there in a period of less precipitation, it is better to choose the periods that start in May and go until November, since in December to April the monthly precipitation is on average greater than 120 mm.
User1: How is the dry area of the island, are there forests or forest reserves in the place?
User2: I know you like forest reserves, but Banaba is more prone to drought, as it is a high island with no natural streams and no water lenses, currently the center of the island is uninhabitable due to exploitation, and the forests are limited to the coastal area. , formed mainly by mangoes, fire trees, guava, tapioca and common Kiribati shrubs, such as salted grass. including reports that in 1873, there was a drought so severe that it lasted 3 years and killed more than three quarters of the population and destroyed almost all trees; many of those who survived left the island, and only a few managed to return, often years later.
User1: What kind of material is extracted from the island?","User2: The exploration of the island began with the Pacific Islands Company, under the command of John T. Arundel, they identified petrified guano, which is a high-grade phosphate rock, used as a potent fertilizer. The exploration of phosphate rock took place from 1900 to 1979, and simply took 90% of the islands surface. I believe it is a terrible thing to imagine for someone who, like you, is concerned with the preservation of nature; the site is a low coral atoll, but less susceptible to sea level rise and unfortunately it is known that it is the desire of the Kiribati government to reopen mining in Banaba, despite being strongly contested by many in the Banaban diaspora."

User2: The Walls of Constantinople were the last great fortification of the antiquity, an advanced defensive system that probably wouldnt envy the most elaborate walls and fortifications in your favorite siege videogames.
User1: Are the walls well preserved if I ever want to visit Istanbul to see them?
User2: The walls survived mostly intact until some dismantling action took place during the Ottoman period in the 19th century to allow the city outgrow its medieval boundaries. Even after the lack of maintenance many parts of the structure are still standing today, but a large-scale restoration program has been going since the 1980s, not the kind of initiative youd donate money to, but still important for the preservation of the monument.
User1: Can you tell me the approximate time when the walls where built?
User2: Constantinoples Walls were built when the new capital of the Roman Empire was founded by Constantine the Great. The so called ""Second Rome"" or ""New Rome"" was inaugurated on 11 May 330 AD.

User1: How did the monastery name come about?
User2: As you are curious about the name of the monastery, the name Divljana is derived from the Latin Divus, which means ""divine"" or ""god"". Professor S. Petrović mentions toponyms with the words base and root: giant (Ser. Див) and wild (Ser. Дивји). The giants were part of Serbian pre-Christian mythology. The Serbian word div (Ser. Див) was derived from the word dievo, and related words were used in Indo-European languages to name gods: Indian Deva, Daeva or Divus from ancient Persian and Latin God. However, it is obvious that the current name Divljana comes from the Latin word Divian, which means ""land of the gods"" (Mr. Боговина).
User1: What was there before the monastery in that area?","User2: Acoording to various records and sources, it can be assumed that the area of the present village of Divljana was one of the hallowed areas of the Triballi (Thracians) tribe who resided there in old periods. Only one kilometer (0.62 mile) from the current location of the monastery, there was a Bronze Age settlement, Igrište, from around 1200 BC."

As you like to walk on trails in the forest, you may like to observe the route through various types of forests; like the seasonal deciduous forest next to the mountains dorsal formations and a stretch of fir forest from the Southern Appalachians in the upper elevations.

Since you like running, I imagine you will like this place.
User1: How did Cresta Run come about?
User2: The Cresta Run and the SMTC were founded by supporters of the sled who adopted a technique with the head (tilted) to descend an icy run, as opposed to the feet (bench press) and a little faster running. Since you like ice, Im sure you will like this place.
User1: How did this sport come about?
User2: The two evolving sports were natural extensions of the invention of riding sledges during the early 1870s by British guests at the Kulm hotel in St. Moritz; the initial rustic sleds were developed almost accidentally, and took the competition to the streets and shortcuts of the mountainous center of St. Moritz, but they posed a risk to others, and this gave impetus to the direction of the sleds, and soon the corridors evolved to allow some direction along the longer curved streets of the 1870s, and also allowed for higher speeds on longer journeys. Since you like sports, I believe you will like this one too.
User1: How is the run?","User2: The top of the runway is located under the ruins of a 12th century church demolished in 1890, known as the Leaning Tower. The overall drop is 157 m (515 feet) and the fall length ranges from 2.8 to 1 to 8.7 to 1."

User2: This is The Hans Lollik Islands located in USA, which you want to visit.
User1: What is the place known for?
User2: As you are interested in island, The Hans Lollik Islands are two privately-owned islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
User1: What is the terrestrial features?
User2: As you are interested in terrestrial features, The terrestrial features of the Hans Lollik group are functions of their natural topography, exposure to trade winds, and consequences of human occupation. In part because of its low elevation, GHL receives about 44 inches (1,120 mm) of rainfall annually. The east and northeast slopes experience regular northeasterly trade winds. The leeward hillsides and guts retain more moisture and support plant communities that differ from those on windward slopes in growth form and species composition.
User1: What is Trade winds?
User2: The Virgin Islands lie in the “Easterlies” or “Trade Winds” which traverse the southern part of the ""Bermuda High"" pressure area. Thus, the predominant winds are usually from the east-northeast and east. These trade winds vary seasonally and are broadly divided into four seasonal modes: December to February; March to May; June to August; and September to November. There are numerous disturbances during the year, especially squalls and thunderstorms. These occur most frequently during the summer, lasting only a few hours and cause no pronounced change in the trade winds. So, you should keep in mind of this when you visit this island.
User1: What is animal life?
User2: It will be sad news, if you like mammals because no native terrestrial mammals occur on either Great Hans Lollik or Little Hans Lollik. The black rat (Rattus rattus) was introduced by early European settlers within the last 500 years. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), cats (Felis cattus) and donkeys (Equus asinus) have been intentionally released. There should be four native species of bats present: Noctilio leporinus (a fishing bat), Molossus molossus (a small insectivore), Jamaican fruit bat Artibeus jamaicensis, and Antillean fruit-eating bat Brachyphylla cavernarum (a pollen and nectar feeder).
User1: What is Cetaceans and other marine species?","User2: The most common cetacean species to move through the waters of the greater Hans Lollik area include bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). Some pilot whales (Globicephala melaena) may also occur in the area. The presence of humpback whales is seasonal, with peak migrations occurring during January through March. In addition to reef fish, schooling fish have been evaluated in the area around GHL and Litte Hans Lollik. Fish abundance is greatest in the offshore area of the east coast fringing reef and in the deep-water areas off the northwest corner of GHL. Three sea turtle species occur around the island, the hawksbill turtle, green turtle, and leatherback turtle. If you love animals, you should visit this island and take a look around various animals."

User1: What is the history of this place?
User2: As you are interested in history, the purpose of this mosque was for it to be private to the royal court (unlike the Shah Mosque, which was meant for the public). For this reason, the mosque does not have any minarets and is smaller. Indeed, few Westerners at the time of the Safavids even paid any attention to this mosque, and they certainly did not have access to it. It was not until centuries later, when the doors were opened to the public, that ordinary people could admire the effort that Shah Abbas had put into making this a sacred place for the ladies of his harem, and the exquisite tile-work, which is far superior to that covering the Shah Mosque.

The poem of Shaykh Bahai on the right wall prays for help from the Fourteen Immaculate Ones (Muhammad, Fatima and the Twelve Imams), while the inscriptions on the interior of the dome emphasize the virtues of charity, prayer and honesty, as well as the correctness of following Islam and its prophets versus the error of other religions.

User2: This curious public sculpture is the Cloud Gate and was created by the British artist, Sir Anish Kapoor, it is the centerpiece of AT&T Plaza in Millennium Park, in the community area of ​​Loop in Chicago, Illinois. As you are planning a trip to Chicargo, I believe that this beautiful vision can inspire you in your design work.
User1: What an interesting format, tell me more about this sculpture.
User2: The sculpture was nicknamed ""The Bean"" because of its shape, at first the author of the work did not like it, but later he liked it. It is made up of 168 welded stainless steel plates, but its highly polished exterior shows visible seams, its total weight is 110 tonnes and because it is a place of high artistic expression I chose it to introduce you, I believe it is worth including it on your list of places to visit.
User1: Now you have won me over, I want to know more about this beautiful sculpture, what other details about it can you tell me?
User2: As you work with design you will like to know that although the author of the work does not draw with computers, computational modeling was essential, and this generated some problems and concerns that were overcome architect Norman Foster who almost believed that the work would be impossible. Finally, he materialized this beautiful work that has a recess whose mirrored surface provides multiple reflections of any object below it, and allows visitors to pass under it through its arch, to the other side, to see the entire structure.
User1: It must have been a very hard job to build this piece of art, do you have any reports on that?
User2: Yes you are right, it was a great job, initially a tent was erected around the sculpture and a team of 24 people polished the seams between each plate, then grinding, sanding and polishing the seams, for that 6 levels of framed scaffolding erected on the sides of the sculpture, climbing ropes and harnesses were also used to reach areas of difficult access. Each weld in the Cloud Gate went through a five-stage process, necessary to produce the mirror finish of the sculpture, which was completed in 2005.
User1: Do you have any curiosity about the place to tell me?
User2: Yes, certainly! In 2015, a sculpture similar to Cloud Gate was erected in China at a site of an oil discovery, allegedly designed to resemble an oil bubble. Eduardo Peñalver, Dean of Cornell Law School, did not like it and said that it is ""most likely"" a copyright infringement against Cloud Gate, the author of the work, Kapoor expected a legal action, but Mayor Rahm Emanuel acted mildly and said it was a flattering imitation.

Modest defences based around simple blockhouses and towers existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were limited in scale. Worsleys Tower, for example, built opposite the future site of Hurst Castle in the 1520s, was too small to hold powerful artillery and considered by surveyors in 1539 to be ""one of the worst devised things"" they had seen.

It was generally well run over its history and maintained a good reputation for the life led by its canons. As with other Premonstratensian houses, Titchfield Abbey was visited once a year by the father-abbot from the parent house (in this case Halesowen Abbey); or instead, in certain years, by a commission of the General Chapter of Prémontré, the headquarters of the Premonstratensian Order. The abbey remained tolerably solvent for most of its existence, however, in common with many religious houses and secular lords it experienced severe financial difficulties in the latter half of the 14th century and the early 15th century due to the economic and social crisis resulting from the effects of the Black Death.

User1: What is dissolution of this place?

In 1535 the abbeys income was assessed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIIIs great survey of church finances, at £280 gross, £249 net, so it avoided being destroyed in the first round of suppressions in 1536. However, several important courtiers, especially Thomas Wriothesley, desired to seize the abbey for themselves and put great pressure on the abbot, John Salisbury, Suffragan Bishop of Thetford to surrender on terms before he was made to by force. Abbot John bribed Wriothesley heavily to hold off, but when it was obvious to them that their abbey was doomed he and his canons took steps to secure their personal future by realising the assets for cash, including selling off the abbeys livestock, treasures and church plate. Titchfield finally fell in December 1537.
User1: What is the current situation?","User2: Still you can see major remains of the abbey and Place House if you visit although a great deal has been destroyed. In fact, the pulling down of Place House has revealed more of the abbey than would otherwise be visible. The nave of the church still stands to full height and with it Wriothesleys gatehouse. To the east of the gatehouse ruins, the barest outline of the former church can be seen, including the choir and transepts. Fragments of the cloister buildings survive, including the entrance arches to the chapter house and library in the east range."

"I am impressed and thrilled by the look of Egyptian pyramids.I am a fan of egyptologists work.I hate when I procrastinate and leave unfinished work.I have amazing photos I took in Giza, Egypt.I have an uncle who speaks German and works in Berlin.","User1: I know this place, but I dont remember the name of this place.
User2: Its the Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet El Aryan in Egypt, the name used by egyptologists like those you admire to describe a large shaft part of an unfinished pyramid in that location.
User1: Why is it unfinished?
User2: Very little is known about the pyramid, because only the natural bedrock square base was finished.

User1: The 4th Dynasty of this Baka prince when was it in the Egypt timeline?

Another point that deserves to be highlighted, especially for those who like historical places and frequented by renowned people and artists, is that the café is historically highlighted for its role in the riots of 1848 against the Habsburg monarchy, and was an attraction for artists of the last century, from the French novelist Stendhal to Lord Byron and the Italian writer Dario Fo.

Later, his son Antonio expanded the facilities to cover the entire block, he was the one who asked Giuseppe Jappelli, the engineer and architect to redesign the place, integrating all buildings and facades into a single unit, creating an eclectic exterior with diverse facades.
User1: Currently, how is the situation of Café Padrocchi?","User2: Well, currently the Café is managed by a leading company in food and beverages, it took over the management of Caffè Pedrocchi; together with the City Hall of Padua, they intend to contribute to the renovation project of the building, respecting the original structure and its historicity, which will be great as it will keep alive the history of this wonderful heritage of the city of Padua."

I would like to visit England.I am interested in abbey.I am interested in the history.I am interested in building.I like to research about historic buildings.,"User1: Where is this place?
User2: This is Titchfield Abbey located in England, which you want to visit.
User1: What is the place known for?
User2: As you are interested in abbey, Titchfield Abbey is a medieval abbey and later country house, located in the village of Titchfield near Fareham in Hampshire, England.
User1: What is the history of this place?
User2: As you are interested in history, the internal affairs of the abbey seem to have been largely quiet. It was generally well run over its history and maintained a good reputation for the life led by its canons. As with other Premonstratensian houses, Titchfield Abbey was visited once a year by the father-abbot from the parent house (in this case Halesowen Abbey); or instead, in certain years, by a commission of the General Chapter of Prémontré, the headquarters of the Premonstratensian Order. The abbey remained tolerably solvent for most of its existence, however, in common with many religious houses and secular lords it experienced severe financial difficulties in the latter half of the 14th century and the early 15th century due to the economic and social crisis resulting from the effects of the Black Death.
User1: Do they have library?
User2: Yes, I will recommend this plcae if you like library. The Premonstratensians placed great emphasis on scholarship and the canons of Titchfield possessed a very impressive library, the catalogue for which survives. There were 224 volumes, each containing a number of different works bound together, as was common in the period, and some must have been very large to contain all the works recorded for them. The books were systematically organised by subject, shelf and location in the library room (probably the chamber between the chapter house and the church as this was the traditional location). There were books in Latin, English and French covering theology, church history, writings of the Fathers of the Church, medicine, law, philosophy, grammar, travel, legends, romances and records of the abbey.
User1: What is dissolution of this place?
User2: Since you are interested in the dissolution of the abbey, I will tell you the story. The abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1537. In 1535 the abbeys income was assessed in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIIIs great survey of church finances, at £280 gross, £249 net, so it avoided being destroyed in the first round of suppressions in 1536. However, several important courtiers, especially Thomas Wriothesley, desired to seize the abbey for themselves and put great pressure on the abbot, John Salisbury, Suffragan Bishop of Thetford to surrender on terms before he was made to by force. Abbot John bribed Wriothesley heavily to hold off, but when it was obvious to them that their abbey was doomed he and his canons took steps to secure their personal future by realising the assets for cash, including selling off the abbeys livestock, treasures and church plate.
User1: What is the current situation?","User2: Fortunately, you can still see major remains of the abbey and Place House though a great deal has been destroyed. In fact, the pulling down of Place House has revealed more of the abbey than would otherwise be visible. The nave of the church still stands to full height and with it Wriothesleys gatehouse. To the east of the gatehouse ruins, the barest outline of the former church can be seen, including the choir and transepts. Fragments of the cloister buildings survive, including the entrance arches to the chapter house and library in the east range."

Active volcanism happens where the Nazca plate is subdivided under the South American plate, and the plates are separated by shallow subduction zones, with no current volcanism then these shallower zones were attributed to the high speed of the plate collision, the young age of the subductive oceanic lithosphere and the curvature of the subductive plate.
