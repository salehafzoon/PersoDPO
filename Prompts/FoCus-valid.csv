Im going on an exploratory trip to Oregon.I love to climb mountains.I like to look at the landscape in lookouts.I have been pursuing leisure activities.I care about the local fauna and flora.,"User1: Wow, this is amazing! What is this?
User2: Ever since you told me youre going on an exploratory trip to Oregon, Ive been looking for places that might interest you, so I found Roxy Ann Peak, also known as Roxy Ann Butte, a 3,576-foot-high mountain in the Western Cascade Range in east end of Medford, Oregon.
User1: Wow! It seems like an interesting place! Tell me more about this place.
User2: As you love to climb mountains, you will like to know about the formation of this important mountain; Roxy Ann Peak is made up of several geological layers, and most of its peak is of volcanic origin originating from the Oligocene era; the topographic prominence of the peak is relatively small, at 753 feet, rising to 2,200 feet above Medford; externally on its lower slopes they are covered by savanna vegetation with oaks and open pastures and on the upper slopes and ridge, it is formed by mixed coniferous forests, stopping before the summit; its importance for the city of Medford is inducible, as it has an unparalleled recreational resource.
User1: What leisure activities are available at Roxy Ann Peak?
User2: When I told you about this mountain, it was not by chance, I know that here you will find the leisure you are always looking for; starting with your own view of the lookout, which you love, hiking, picnicking, mountain biking and horseback riding; on the mountain you can choose from the 6 km of designated trails in Prescott Park, which vary in difficulty, from moderate to steep. Some private companies want to help improve mountain and conservation activities by creating private recreational activities on site, for example, we have the International Mountain cycling Association, which launched a conceptual plan detailing future improvements to the parks trail system and the Prescott Park itself which launched in 2012 a Challenge Course, operated by Synergo.
User1: I got curious. Tell me about this challenge course operated by Synergo?
User2: This is a very interesting course, the company Synergo, based in Tigard, created this course based on 15 elements - eight low and seven high - vary from 2 to 40 feet (0.61 to 12 m) above the ground, each one is formed by various combinations of ropes, wires, platforms, ladders and swings, I believe that it can be classified as a more radical activity and that requires a certain level of fitness.
User1: What can you tell me about the local fauna and flora?
User2: As you have been concerned with the fauna and flora, I believe that at the Roxy Ann peak you will find a high biodiversity present in the lower slopes of the peak with oak savanna vegetation and open pastures. These conditions include sclerophilous shrubs, Oregon white oak, grasses such as blue wildrye and prairie Junegrass; the mountain peak is also home to many species of birds, while the mammals that inhabit the mountain include black-tailed deer, cougars, lynx, skunks, raccoons.
User1: How can I get to the park to access the Roxy Ann Peak?","User2: You can access the peak and park via Roxy Ann Road, on the south side of the mountain; there are two gates on the road; the first is close to the base of the peak and is open and closed at a set time, and the second is about a mile beyond, on the edge of the park, and is closed to all unauthorized motor vehicles. if you drive another mile past the second gate, the road splits in a 2.7 mile loop around the summit, this is where Tower Road starts on the north side of the circuit and climbs to the top of the peak."

Bell and Sumner Tainter.

User1: Do you have any more curiosities to tell me?
User2: Bell, besides being an inventor, he was also a businessman, and still lives today in the soul of the famous Sony brand.

User1: Yes, this will be useful! What can you tell me about the local characteristics?
User2: As a Washington State resident and lover of nature-related issues, I think its important to know that at the beginning the course of the Columbia Glacial River to the southern highlands created an ice dam, which retracted the waters of Columbia Glacial Lake, forcing them east of Washington. Without finding a gap, the river made its own way through the division, creating the Upper Coulee; upon encountering a steep slope, the new river would have cascaded from the 800-foot edge onto a wide plain where Coulee City and Dry Falls State Park are now.
User1: What can you tell me about Dry Falls?
User2: The Upper Grand Coulee was formed by the erosion caused by the water current on the surface, forming a waterfall of 240 meters north of Coulee City, following its course of erosion to the north creating the canyon.

User1: I think it is a good place to visit, how is the tourism issue in the Grand Coulee region?","User2: Currently the Grand Coulee is home to 2 state parks, Sun Lakes and Steamboat Rock and the entire region around it has become a haven for wildlife, and that includes the famous bald eagle; there are several lakes, mineral springs, hunting and fishing regions and water sports of all kinds.
